http://www.laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/bootstrap/manual/current/en/[AsciiDoc-Bootstrap] 4.1.0
has just been released.

Issues fixed :

* `toc` and `toc2` attributes works as expected

More details on milestone https://github.com/llaville/asciidoc-bootstrap-backend/milestones/v4.1.0[v4.1.0]

Behaviors changes :

* `sidebar` attribute was removed. Use instead the standard `toc-placement` attribute.
* We used the Bootstrap Panel Component rather than `well` css class to render Table Of Contents.

New backend features :

* We have added support for https://octicons.github.com/[Octicons] GitHub icons font.
