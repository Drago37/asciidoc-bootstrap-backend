We are pleased to announce the release of AsciiDoc Bootstrap Backend 4.1, planned for Monday August 4, 2014.

The major issue related to Table Of Contents (TOC and TOC2) are now fixed.

I would like to thanks especially two contributors https://github.com/eruiz[Enrique Ruiz] and 
https://github.com/ShaKeSPeaR[Alexander Spirin] that improve again the backend and make future release 4.1 a new stable version.
