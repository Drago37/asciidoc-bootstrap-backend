:doctitle:    Example for Asciidoc-Bootstrap - {title}


== Basic Releases

[role="lead"]
A basic releases layout with two columns: on left the versions, and on right the changelog content.

Example of Asciidoc document. See source text
footnote:[https://raw.github.com/llaville/asciidoc-bootstrap-backend/master/examples/releases.asciidoc].

We used additional css rules added by file +releases.css+ to give such design.
[source,css]
----
include::releases.css[]
----

== Result with flatly theme

Invoke the following command:
[source,bash]
----
$ asciidoc -b bootstrap -f /path/to/examples/releases.conf -o releases-sample.html /path/to/examples/releases.asciidoc
----

And here are the final result that you should get.

image::images/screenshots/releases-sample.png[link="releases-sample.html",title="My Releases with flatly theme",role="thumbnail",options="align,responsive"]

== About options @to generate documents@

We reused and group all common attributes to generate documents in a standard asciidoc configuration file called `releases.conf`.
