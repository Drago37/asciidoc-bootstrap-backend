== Pygments

[role="lead"]
The http://pygments.org[Pygments] syntax highlighter can be used
for xhtml11, html5 and bootstrap outputs (set the `source-highlighter` attribute to pygments).

Until now, AsciiDoc allow only to use Pygments with a default theme that look like to `emacs` theme.
We have no way to customize this at document build time, unless editing contents of +./stylesheets/pygments.css+ file.

AsciiDoc-Bootstrap backend introduce in version 3.1.0 the new attribute `pygments-style`
to change Pygments stylesheet at document build time.

NOTE: Credit to AsciiDoctor https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/637[GH-637 issue].

By default, AsciiDoc-Bootstrap used the AsciiDoc pygments theme. To change the style,
set the `pygments-style` attribute and assign it the alternate style's name.

[TIP]
=====================================================================
To see what pygments styles you have available, open a terminal and type:
----
$ pygmentize -L styles
----
It will output the style names and brief descriptions.

Pygments 1.5 provides 19 themes, but only 3 pre-defined stylesheets are available
in standard AsciiDoc-Bootstrap backend distribution (default, pastie, monokai).

Here are how to setup other themes. Open a terminal and type:
----
$ pygmentize -f html -S <theme> -a .highlight
----
where +<theme>+ is one of those listed by Pygments (-L style).
Copy output to the AsciiDoc-Bootstrap install dir +stylesheets+ folder in a file
named +pygments.<theme>.css+. (e.g. pygments.tango.css)
=====================================================================

In the example document below, we used the `monokai` style as main theme,
and `pastie` as local theme to highlight a block of CSS code.

CAUTION: Pygments token +<span>+ tags will not use CSS classes, but inline styles.
This is not recommended for larger pieces of code since it increases output size by quite a bit.

NOTE: The source-highlighter `args` attribute allows the inclusion of arbitrary
(highlighter dependent) command options.
