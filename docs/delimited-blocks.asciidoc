== Open Blocks

[role="lead"]
Open blocks are special: they are used to generate document abstracts,
book part introductions and more.

WARNING: Previous version 3, used it to simulate multi columns. Version 4 dropped this behavior.
Don't be afraid, this feature is still possible using the standard Bootstrap classes like `.col-md-*` and so on.
